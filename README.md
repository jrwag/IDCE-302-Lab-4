# IDCE-302-Lab-4

Edited by: Julia Wagner
Date updated: February 18, 2020
Python version 3.4

Purpose: This repo includes three scripts:

1) A function to capitalize letters in the name MacDonald
2) An update to edit a string scraped from the web to include spaces, lines, and commas, as appropriate.
3) A script to pull latitude and longtiude coordinates from a google maps url.

Errors encountered: the script to edits spaces in script 2 is long. Certainly, there is a more succinct way to solve this.
